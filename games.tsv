Azul	https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/230802/azul	Introduced by the Moors, azulejos (originally white and blue ceramic tiles) were fully embraced by the Portuguese when their king Manuel I, on a visit to the Alhambra palace in Southern Spain, was mesmerized by the stunning beauty of the Moorish decorative tiles. The king, awestruck by the interior beauty of the Alhambra, immediately ordered that his own palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles. As a tile-laying artist, you have been challenged to embellish the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora.	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3718275_md.jpg	Abstract, Family	Pattern Building, Set Collection, Tile Placement	Abstract Strategy	30-45	8+	2-4	7.8
Altiplano	https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/234487/altiplano	Altiplano, a bag-building game along the lines of Orléans set in the South American highlands of the Andes — the Altiplano — is not a simple game, presenting players with new challenges time and again. There are various ways to reach the goal, so the game remains appealing to try out new options and strategies, but success or failure also depends on whether your opponents let you do as you like or thwart the strategy you are pursuing. The competition for the individual types of goods is considerable — as is the fun in snatching a coveted extension card from under another player's nose!	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3720608_md.jpg	Action Point Allowance System, Deck/Pool Building, Variable Player Powers	Resource Management	Strategy	60-120	12+	2-4	7.5
Clans of Caledonia	https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/216132/clans-caledonia	Clans of Caledonia is a mid-to-heavy economic game set in 19th-century Scotland. At this time, Scotland made the transition from an agricultural to an industrialized country that heavily relied on trade and export. In the following years, food production increased significantly to feed the population growth. Linen was increasingly substituted by the cheaper cotton and raising sheep was given high importance. More and more distilleries were founded and whisky became the premium alcoholic beverage in Europe.	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3511783_md.png	Strategy	Commodity Speculation, Modular Board, Route/Network Building, Variable Player Powers	Economic	30-120	12+	1-4	8.3
